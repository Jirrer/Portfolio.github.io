    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        Michigan Analytics is a web application designed to visualize the relationship between household income
        and health disparities across Michigan counties. The interactive interface features a map of Michigan
        split into individual counties, allowing users to either click on a county or search for it by name.
        <br><br>
        Once a county is selected, two line graphs are displayed:
        <ul>
            <li>Household income trends over the years for the selected county.</li>
            <li>The county's health ranking compared to the rest of the state over time.</li>
        </ul>
        All health and income data is sourced from the Michigan Census Bureau and stored locally in CSV files
        for efficient access and analysis.
    </p>

    <h2>How-To</h2>
    <p>
        Using Michigan Analytics:
        <ol>
            <li>Open the application in a supported web browser.</li>
            <li>Locate the county of interest by either:
                <ul>
                    <li>Clicking directly on the map.</li>
                    <li>Using the search bar to type the countyâ€™s name.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>View the two generated line graphs showing income trends and health ranking data for that county.</li>
            <li>Compare and analyze the data to better understand potential correlations between income levels and health outcomes.</li>
        </ol>

    <h1>Documentation</h1>
    <h2>Prerequisites</h2>
    <p>
        Michigan Analytics requires the following:
        <ul><li>
            A modern web browser - Chrome, Edge, or Firefox recommended for best performance.
        </li></ul>
        <ul><li>
            Node.js 16 or higher - For backend data handling (if server-side processing is used).
        </li></ul>
        <ul><li>
            CSV data files - Containing household income and health ranking data sourced from the Michigan Census Bureau.
        </li></ul>
    </p>

    <h2>Data Configuration</h2>
    <p>
        The application reads data from two primary CSV datasets:
        <ul>
            <li><code>income.csv</code> - Contains annual household income figures for each county over multiple years.</li>
            <li><code>health.csv</code> - Contains annual health ranking data for each county compared to the rest of Michigan.</li>
        </ul>
        These files should be placed in the <code>/data</code> directory of the project. The file format must remain
        consistent for the application to parse them correctly.
    </p>

    <h2>Frontend</h2>
    <p>
        The frontend is built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, featuring:
        <ul>
            <li>An interactive map of Michigan with clickable counties.</li>
            <li>A search bar for quickly locating specific counties.</li>
            <li>Two dynamic line graphs rendered using a charting library (e.g., Chart.js or D3.js) to visualize income and health data.</li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    <h2>Backend</h2>
    <h3>Data Handling</h3>
    <p>
        The backend reads and processes CSV data from the <code>/data</code> directory. Data is filtered by county
        selection, then sent to the frontend for graph rendering.
    </p>

    <h3>Map Integration</h3>
    <p>
        The county map is generated using a GeoJSON or SVG-based representation of Michigan. Click events and search
        queries trigger updates to the displayed graphs.
    </p>

    <h3>Data Source</h3>
    <p>
        All datasets originate from the <a href="https://www.census.gov/" target="_blank">Michigan Census Bureau</a>
        and are periodically updated to ensure accurate trend analysis.
