    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        While Similar v2 builds upon the foundation set in version 1, it operates very different
        under the hood. As opposed to being merely a Gemini AI wrapper, version 2 houses a 
        database for the codebase to search for songs locally. This limits external API calls 
        dramatically. Another big change in version 2 is the UI. Similar v2 is offered in a .NET app environment
        rather than a web app.
    </p>
    <h2>How-To</h2>
    <p>
        To use Similar v2, simply paste a public spotify playlist url into the search box. The
        program will then provide 30 new recommended songs.

    <h1>Documentation</h1>
    <h2>Prerequisites</h2>
    <p>
        Similar version 2.0 requires a couple prerequisites before it can be ran on your
        machine:
        <ul><li>
            Python 3.7 or higher - Used by backend .py scripts, as well as embedding
            Python into the c# frontend. 
        </li></ul>
        <ul><li>
            Spotify Web API key - Key will be stored within a .env file and is required
            for the program to be able to contact Spotify's servers.
        </li></ul>
        <ul><li>
            A public Spotify playlist - To tell the program the type of recommended songs
            that are desired. 
        </li></ul>
    </p>
    <h2>Configuring Python</h2>
    <p>
        For the program to work, Python's DLL file, environment path, and lib/site-packages
        directory MUST all be configured. The default directory on windows for these files
        is normally "C:\Users\username\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python39". These file 
        paths can potiently be difficult to locate if Python was set up using a custom
        installation. The required file locations should be accessible using the "where 
        python" command in cmd. Once these paths are located on you machine, go to the 
        .env file located within \src. Then, simply paste each path into the corrisponding 
        variable.
        <br>It is important to note that moving any of these Python file paths will cause
         Similar to become unstable and stop working.
    </p>
    <h2>Frontend</h2>
    <p>
        Similars frontend is written in c# on the WPF (Windows Presentation Foundation)
        framework. There is no extra setup
        required for these c# files as everything is handled during the installation.
    </p>
    <h2>Backend</h2>
    <h3>Scripts</h3>
    <p>
        The backend's scripts are written in Python and interact heavily with the Spotify
        Web API. This interaction is carried out through the Spotipy module.
    </p>
    <h3>APIs</h3>
    <p>
        You will need to access a Spotify Web API key - 
        <a class="InlineLInk" href="https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api"
        target="_blank">Spotify Web API Info</a>. Your Client ID and Client Secret will need
        to be pasted into the .env file located within \src and should be ensured that they
        are up to date. The python scripts are set up to not overload Spotify's requests 
        limit and will stop sending calls if they detect a request overload. This can 
        become essecially prominate when using the methods within the "Update_db.py" 
        file (see the Database section for more). This file keeps track of the number of 
        added songs - or attempted added songs - for that day and will stop sending request 
        if that number becomes to large. This means there is a set number of new songs that 
        can be added per day, or else spotify will block all request coming from your key 
        (making the program unusable). 
    </p>
    <h3>Database</h3>
    <p>
        The "Spotify_IDs.db" file is a sqlite3 file that houses all the IDs, Artists, and
        Genres for the songs used by the program. New songs can either be added manually, 
        or can come from the "Update_db.py" file located within \src (IMPORTANT - see 
        APIs section for details on using Update_db). Each value type is TEXT.
