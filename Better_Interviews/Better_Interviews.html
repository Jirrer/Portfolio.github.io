    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        Better Interview is a web-based application designed to help job seekers track and prepare for upcoming
        interviews. The app provides a clear visual overview of your interview progress using three circle graphs
        that display the ratio of accepted, pending, and rejected interviews.
        <br><br>
        Beyond tracking, Better Interview also helps with preparation. When a new interview is created, the backend
        sends the interview details to a Gemini AI prompt, which generates a personalized study plan tailored to
        the position, company, and relevant skills.
    </p>

    </p>

    <h2>Configuring Environment Variables</h2>
    <p>
        All required keys and configuration values must be stored in the <code>.env</code> file located in the project root. Example:
    </p>
    <pre>
    GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_key_here
    DATABASE_URL=your_database_connection_string
    </pre>
    <p>
        Keep this file private to ensure sensitive credentials are not exposed.
    </p>

    <h2>Frontend</h2>
    <p>
        The frontend is built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, providing a responsive layout for both desktop and
        mobile use. The dashboard prominently features three animated circle graphs showing the distribution of
        interview statuses.
    </p>

    <h2>Backend</h2>
    <h3>Interview Tracking</h3>
    <p>
        The backend stores all interview data, including the position, company name, date, and status. This data
        is used to calculate the ratios displayed in the frontend circle graphs.
    </p>

    <h3>Gemini Integration</h3>
    <p>
        When a new interview is added, the backend sends the interview details to a Gemini AI prompt. Gemini
        processes the information and returns a tailored study plan, which may include company research topics,
        common role-specific interview questions, and suggested practice exercises.
    </p>

    <h3>Database</h3>
    <p>
        The database stores all interviews with their associated metadata. Status updates trigger the frontend
        graphs to refresh, ensuring real-time accuracy.
