    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        Similar is a web-based application that generates a new recommended playlist based on an existing
        playlist provided by the user. The app supports both Spotify and Apple Music as sources, allowing you
        to choose your preferred music platform.
        <br><br>
        To generate recommendations, Similar functions as a Gemini AI wrapper. Once a playlist is submitted,
        the application sends it through the Gemini model to analyze the tracklist and identify 30 new songs
        that match the style, genre, and mood of the original. The recommended songs are then displayed directly
        on the web interface for easy viewing and access.
    </p>

    <h2>How-To</h2>
    <p>
        Using Similar is straightforward:
        <ol>
            <li>Select your preferred music platform: Spotify or Apple Music.</li>
            <li>Paste the URL of a public playlist from the chosen platform into the search box.</li>
            <li>Click the "Generate" button.</li>
        </ol>
        Within moments, Similar will display 30 recommended tracks on the screen, curated to match the feel of
        your original playlist.

    <h1>Documentation</h1>
    <h2>Prerequisites</h2>
    <p>
        Similar requires the following before it can run:
        <ul><li>
            Node.js 16 or higher - Required for running the backend API calls and handling Gemini requests.
        </li></ul>
        <ul><li>
            Spotify Web API key (for Spotify support) - Stored in a <code>.env</code> file for secure use.
        </li></ul>
        <ul><li>
            Apple Music API key (for Apple Music support) - Also stored in the <code>.env</code> file.
        </li></ul>
        <ul><li>
            Gemini API key - Used to access the Gemini AI model for playlist recommendations.
        </li></ul>
    </p>

    <h2>Configuring Environment Variables</h2>
    <p>
        All API keys must be placed in the <code>.env</code> file located in the project root. Example:
    </p>
    <pre>
    SPOTIFY_API_KEY=your_spotify_key_here
    APPLE_MUSIC_API_KEY=your_apple_music_key_here
    GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_key_here
    </pre>
    <p>
        Ensure these keys are kept private and never exposed in public repositories.
    </p>

    <h2>Frontend</h2>
    <p>
        The frontend is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with a responsive layout for desktop and mobile
        devices. It includes input fields for playlist URLs, a platform selector, and a results area to display
        recommended songs.
    </p>

    <h2>Backend</h2>
    <h3>Gemini Integration</h3>
    <p>
        The backend acts as a Gemini AI wrapper, sending playlist data for analysis. Gemini processes the submitted
        playlist, evaluates track characteristics, and returns 30 curated recommendations.
    </p>

    <h3>APIs</h3>
    <p>
        Depending on the chosen platform, the backend interacts with either:
        <ul>
            <li><a href="https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api" target="_blank">Spotify Web API</a></li>
            <li><a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/applemusicapi" target="_blank">Apple Music API</a></li>
        </ul>
        These APIs are used to validate playlist URLs, fetch track details, and format the data for Geminiâ€™s
        processing.
    </p>

    <h3>Display of Results</h3>
    <p>
        Once the 30 recommended tracks are returned from Gemini, they are displayed dynamically on the results
        page. Each track listing includes the song title, artist, and an optional direct link to the song on the
        selected music platform.
