    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        Battleship Bot is a C# project developed as part of a group assignment where the goal was to create an
        automated Battleship player capable of competing against other bots. The bot uses strategic algorithms
        to place ships, target opponents, and optimize its chances of winning the game.
    </p>

    <h2>How-To</h2>
    <p>
        To use Battleship Bot:
        <ol>
            <li>Compile the C# project using your preferred IDE (e.g., Visual Studio).</li>
            <li>Run the bot executable to start a match against another bot.</li>
            <li>The bot will automatically place its ships and make moves without user input.</li>
            <li>Observe the match progress via the console or UI output (depending on implementation).</li>
        </ol>
    </p>

    <h1>Documentation</h1>
    <h2>Prerequisites</h2>
    <p>
        Battleship Bot requires:
        <ul><li>
            .NET Framework or .NET Core SDK installed - Compatible with the C# version used in the project.
        </li></ul>
        <ul><li>
            An IDE or compiler capable of building C# projects (Visual Studio recommended).
        </li></ul>
    </p>

    <h2>Project Structure</h2>
    <p>
        The project consists of multiple classes handling different aspects of the bot:
        <ul>
            <li><code>Ship</code> - Manages ship placement and tracking.</li>
            <li><code>Board</code> - Represents the game board state.</li>
            <li><code>BotLogic</code> - Contains the targeting and decision-making algorithms.</li>
            <li><code>GameController</code> - Coordinates game flow and bot interactions.</li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    <h2>Bot Strategy</h2>
    <p>
        The bot employs a combination of probability-based targeting and pattern recognition to efficiently find
        and sink opponent ships. It adapts its strategy based on hit/miss feedback to improve accuracy over time.
    </p>

    <h2>Running Matches</h2>
    <p>
        Matches can be run locally against other bots by launching multiple instances or integrating into a
        tournament framework. The botâ€™s input and output are designed to be compatible with the provided
        Battleship game engine.
